# ComputerGraphics-EggCatcherGame
“An Egg Catcher Game” is a Python project which catches eggs that fall randomly.


This project uses a Python standard GUI library 'Tkinter'. Tkinter is the inbuilt Python module that is used to create GUI applications. This project also uses a Python standard library ‘PIL’. The Python Imaging Library or PIL is an amazing Python library used for image processing.


The player gets 3 lives or we can say three chances after losing all three chances it displays “Game Over”.The player loses one life if he/she misses catching one egg. On the scoreboard present at the top, the scores are displayed depending on the eggs caught by the basket.

Here are a few screenshots of the egg catcher game.
